The main issue is with the home page. When you click on the siderbar menu button the content of the home page is stuck on top of the sidebar menu.
I want it to be in such a way that when you click on the sidebar navigation button it will show and home page content will also resize.
The second part is when you click on the power button login form which is a modal form failed to pop up.
